## Getting the Source Data

The data used for this work is from CrowdAI Spotify skip challenge
https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge

We trimmed the data to only include 103k most frequent tracks(items) only to expedite model iterations
You may download data used for this project in this google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UrZKi6goybLZZlRA9pUelOFY-VTsqJFE/view


### How to run

#### Deep reinforcement learning
Download the code to ./DRL/data 
The skip prediction code can be found in .DRL/model/RL_based-binary.ipynb
The sequence prediction code can be found in .DRL/model/RL_Based_seq.ipynb
